XMLGEN -- A module to generate XML and/or HTML by writing Tcl code which
          translates itself.
          (C) 2002 Harald Kirsch

WHAT IS IT?
===========

You declare the XML tags you want as Tcl commands. Then you can use
the natural bracing structure of Tcl to write XML while having all the
niceties of the script language to define shortcuts or add dynamic
content. 

A simple example based on htmlgen, a module which predefines all the
HTML tags.

set Title "A Simple Example"
html ! {
  head ! {
    title - $Title
  }
  body ! {
    h1 - $Title
    p - As you can see, title and major headline agree.
  }
}

INSTALLATION
============
This package contains three pieces to be installed in different
directories of your choice:

  1) the Tcl package xmlgen (contains htmlgen)
  2) HTML documentation for both
  3) cgi-enabled documentation, mainly here as a proof of concept and
     as an example

The QUICK INSTALL goes like

  tclsh bras-sa prefix=/usr/local cgi_prefix=/home/html/cgi install

This will create the following directories with some content:

  /usr/local/lib/xmlgen-1.0       (possibly different version number)
  /usr/local/doc/xmlgen-1.0       (dto.)
  /home/html/cgi/xmlgen-1.0	  (dto.)
    
NOTES:

1) For the cgi-enabled documentation to work you need two things:
  a) Convince your web server to run $CGDIR/index as a Tcl script.
  b) Make sure this script can find a recent tcllib. It needs the
     package ncgi.

2) If you want to set the subdirectory names yourself, then specify
*all* of PKGDIR, DOCDIR and CGIDIR instead of prefix and cgi_prefix.

3) In any case, the parent directory of PKGDIR, /usr/local/lib in the
example, MUST appear in the auto_path variable of the tclsh you intend
to use. (HINT: auto_path is initialized also from the TCLLIBPATH
environment variable.)

4) bras-sa is a standalone version of bras, the make replacement
written in Tcl to be found at http://bras.berlios.de/ . It uses the
brasfile in this directory to do its work.
